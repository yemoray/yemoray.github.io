title: What does a Data Scientist do?
---

Prompts: 
What do you think being a data scientist is about?
What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?
What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?
How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

The Science Council (https://sciencecouncil.org) defines a scientist as "someone who systematically gathers and uses research as evidence, to make hypotheses and test them, to gain and share understanding and knowledge." By this definition, a data scientist is a scientist in every sense of the word, but with research tools that distinguishes the individual from a traditional scientist. These sets of unique research tools include the ability to gather massive amount of data, clean, transform, model and visualize the data, and tell a compelling story to help both individuals and organizations solve problems and make sound decisions.  Another distinction is that, similar to statisticians, data scientists also "get to play in everyone's backyard", to borrow a popular quote by John Wilder Tukey, just as long as they understand the rules of the game being played. As such, data scientists need subject matter expertise to understand the nuances and relevance of the data being worked on.

Apart from having domain knowledge, the two other pillars/knowledge areas a data scientist must have are statistical/analytics, and computer programming (especially languages like Java, Python, R, SAS and SQL). These 3 foundational stones provide the data scientist with the competency needed to be able to solve business (or scientific) problems by developing models, algorithms, and providing insights from data analysis. In some regard, data scientists could be viewed as statisticians, however, both roles are not quite the same.

For instance, the scale of the data data scientists and statistician work on, and the means of data collection, differ significantly. Statisticians usually rely on designed experiments, surveys and polls for small scale, usually structured data collection, while data scientists collect numbers, texts, audio, visuals, mobile data, etc. ,usually measured in scales that could be as great as exabytes. As a result, data scientists typically spend considerable time cleaning and transforming data prior to analysis.
