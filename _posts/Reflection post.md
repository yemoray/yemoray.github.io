title: Reflection   
---
The course so far has felt like drinking water from a fire hose, but it is likely that its partly due to me taking the 10-weeks summer version of the course. So far, the course has exceeded my expectations and I have learned/am learning far more than I imagined. The pacing of the homeworks/projects/exams has been frenetic but I've kept up with the pace so far, although it's required almost every available time I have outside of work and sleep. 

As far as the course content is concerned, I wouldn't change anything. The course nicely balances the fundamentals of learning to code with R and practical applications. I think being able to read in data from APIs and other databases is a valuable skill, and I'm actually considering learning SQL to build on what I've learned so far. The lecture videos are concise and straight to the point, and I am thankful for the numerous references provided. I mainly used SAS when I took ST 517 and ST 518 and it's great to be able to revisit some of the lessons learned during those courses in R. Supervised and unsupervised learning are completely new to me and I look forward to learning more about machine Learning. THe only thing I would change about the course would be to make it available in just the Fall and Spring semesters. It seems like a lot of material to be covered in 10 weeks.
