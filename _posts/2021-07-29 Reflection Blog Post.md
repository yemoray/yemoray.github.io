My thoughts about what a Data Scientist does has not changed since I wrote my initial blog posts, but I have a healthy respect and appreciation for what they do especially having done
some work in Machine Learning.

R has really grown on me after seeing what it can be used for, my introduction to R Shiny has been a particular highlight. I definitely plan to use R going forward, especially in
fitting supervised learning models. I also look forward to using R shiny to present data in an interactive manner (both as a hobby and a visualization tool at work). Mastering R
now will also help in the statistics courses I plan to take after re-enrolling in the masters in statistics program next Summer/Fall.

Beyond learning R to a greater extent than I expected, this course has further enhanced how I approach problem-solving- simply finding a solution to a problem is not enough, doing
so in the most effective and efficient way is even better.I look forward to increasing my knowledge base on statistics to truly unleash what R can do in both statistical analysis and Machine Learning.
