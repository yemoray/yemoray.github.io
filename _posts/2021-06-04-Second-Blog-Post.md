title: Second Post- Thoughts on the R programming language
---

Prior to this semester, the only serious statistical programming language I learned was SAS (I don't think Minitab counts as a programming language in the true sense). Compared to SAS, my initial impression of R is that it offers a more versatile and efficient way to write code, although this comes at the cost of a much steeper learning curve. The `DATA` and `PROC` steps in SAS consist of statements than are mostly easy to remember, and the high-level syntax usded in SAS makes coding easier to learn. R on the other hand is an object-oriented program, and may be more difficult to get used to if the user has no prior experience with other object-oriented programs like Java and C++. I learned Visual Basic in a past life, so learning the R basics was not too bad.

Both programming languages have good graphic user interfaces, but I really prefer that of R because everything is accessable at a glance- from graphs generated, tables created, to help with functions. I especially love R Markdown because of how it seamlessly knits (pardon the pun :) ) code chunks and text together to creater a customized output. SAS has its ODS output systems and macros but doesn't quite allow the same level of customization. So far, I have found the vast array of packages in R (with each having its own syntax) to be both a blessing and a curse. It's great to be able to have several means to solve a given problem, however, no single package can do all things, although `tidyverse` comes close, in my opinion.  SAS on the other hand has a set number of steps, which allows for greater simplicity. For instance, SAS has `PROC GLM`, `PROC GLIMMIX`, `PROC MIXED`, etc. for analysing models, but they all follow similar syntax.

One thing I miss the most about SAS is that it is not case-sensitive. I've lost count of how much time I've spent trying to debug an error in R only to find out that the wrong case was used for a particular object. 

My view on R so far is based on the limited knowledge I currently have, when compared to SAS. I expect that my impressions on R will significantly evolve as the semester progresses.
