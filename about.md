# Professional Summary
Hi there! Thanks for visiting my GitHub blog. This blog started as a requirement for the __ST 558 (Data Science for Statisticians)__, a class I enrolled in during the Summer 2021 semester in fulfilment of the Applied Statistics and Data Management graduate certificate program. I have a diverse background but have been primarily working as material scientist in the tire Industry for the last 9 years. The details of my professional and academic history on are on my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adeyemi-adepetun-92b05918/).

My interest in deepening my knowledge of statistics started a few years ago when I had to figure out how to predict the levels of 3 key starting materials to optimize multiple material properties (responses) simultaneously. After the initial panic subsided, I picked up Douglas Montgomery's best seller _Design and Analysis of Experiments_ and succeeded after figuring out the basic mechanics of the response surface methodology.
