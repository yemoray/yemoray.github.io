# Professional Summary
Hi there! Thanks for visiting my GitHub blog. This blog started as a requirement for the __ST 558 (Data Science for Statisticians)__, a class I am curently enrolled (Summer 2021 semester) in fulfilment of the Applied Statistics and Data Management graduate certificate program. I have a diverse background but have been primarily working as material scientist in the tire Industry for the last 9 years. The details of my professional and academic history on are on my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adeyemi-adepetun-92b05918/).

My interest in deepening my knowledge of statistics started a few years ago when I had to figure out how to predict the levels of 3 key starting materials to optimize multiple material properties (responses) simultaneously. After the initial panic subsided, I picked up Douglas Montgomery's best seller _Design and Analysis of Experiments_ and succeeded after figuring out the basic mechanics of the response surface methodology and using Minitab. I was blown away by the experience and began to imagine how much more I could do once I got a proper training in statistics. The  certificate is the first step and It's my desire to complete the Masters degree.

# Fun and Hobbies 
I've lived in North Carolina for about 5 years (after 10 years in Northeast Ohio, loved Cleveland Downtown, the Cavs and the Blossom music festival. The winter, not so much.) My wife and I love it here and enjoyed our visits to the Biltmore estate:

The view of the Blue Ridge Mountains from the east side balcony was quite a sight to behold. We've also been to Hilton Head Island down in South Carolina and can't get enough of the Coligny beach park. We look forward exploring some of the historic sites in the Carolinas in the near future.

I also enjoy watching soccer when I have the time (being an Arsenal FC supporter is the very definition of longsuffering, case in point:)

In conclusion, I've enjoyed learning statistics (and now Data Science) so far, and look forward to what's possible.
