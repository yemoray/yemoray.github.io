#Professional Summary
Hi there! Thanks for visiting my GitHub blog. This blog started as a requirement for the __ST 558 (Data Science for Statisticians)__, a class I enrolled in during the Summer 2021 semester in fulfilment of the Applied Statistics and Data Management graduate certificate program. I have a diverse background but have been primarily working as material scientist in the tire Industry for the last 9 years.
